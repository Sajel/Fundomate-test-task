###### Task 1:
**a)** Examples of hierarchy are in the CompensationCalculatorTest

**b)** Class for calculation is CompensationCalculator

**c)** Time complexity is O(n) because we are visiting every node of tree once

Notes to task A:
- CompensationCalculator class uses recursion to traverse tree. It can lead to stackoverflow exception. It can be replaced with loop using stack.
